# in any group.  If we later define a group, which we will, it will be
# considered a child of the 'all' group.

# In order to distinguish between a server and the virtual machines it
# will run, we'll need a group to perform host-level changes.  For this
# purpose, we'll use the 'server' group to indicate a host is an actual
# server (or some kind of real hardware).
