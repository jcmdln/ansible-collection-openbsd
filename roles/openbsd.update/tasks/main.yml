# openbsd.update/tasks/main.yml

# While sysupgrade(8) was provided to OpenBSD 6.5 users, it is not
# by default included in base unless all available patches have been
# applied using syspatch(8).  For the sake of simplicity in this play
# we'll only attempt to use sysupgrade(8) in OpenBSD 6.6 or later since
# it is included by default.
#
# I suppose this could be expanded to simply check if the binary is
# present, but we should deal with absolute known quantities whenever
# possible to reduce mental complexity.
- name: (sysupgrade) upgrade to latest release or snapshot
  when: ansible_distribution_version >= '6.6'
  sysupgrade:
    upgrade: yes
  notify:
    - restart host
    - reinstall packages
    - delete unused packages


# In cases where a user may upgrade to a new release and it has been
# some time since last updating, there may also be patches to apply
# after the upgrade.  Here we will force the previously notified
# handlers to run before continuing, so that tasks run in the order
# required to ensure no issues arise.
- name: (sysupgrade) run handlers now if upgrade completed
  meta: flush_handlers


# For OpenBSD hosts running 6.1 or later and _NOT_ running current, we
# can patch the base system using syspatch(8).
- name: (syspatch) apply all available patches
  when:
    - ansible_distribution_version >= '6.1'
    - ansible_distribution_release != 'current'
  syspatch:
    apply: true
  notify:
    - restart host


# Regardless of any above actions, we should update any installed
# packages.  One missing condition is that if our `reinstall packages`
# handler runs, this is pointless.
- name: update packages
  when: packages_reinstalled is undefined
