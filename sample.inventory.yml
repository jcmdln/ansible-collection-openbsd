  # These are global variables.  Almost everything has been set as intended in

  # Below are hosts we want to perform actions on, but not assign them a group
  # which would imply a specific purpose.  One example are hosts that should be
  # patched, but aren't specifically running some type of service as denoted by
  # the name of the groups below.
  hosts:
    # This can be a domain name or IP address

# The "everything" group is a custom group that is a child of all following
# groups, meaning that this is an all-in-one host that all services will be
# deployed to.

# Right now this is primarily for testing things, so I personally wouldn't
# suggest being so brazen.

  hosts:
    # This can be a domain name or IP address, and in the example below I've

      # IP address that your host can actually reach over ssh.

# The "ports" group is a custom group that defines hosts that should be
# configured for building packages in the ports tree.
ports:
  # The "children" moniker here allows us to define groups under it, so rather
  # than declaring each host multiple times we can collate the hosts of these
  # groups.
