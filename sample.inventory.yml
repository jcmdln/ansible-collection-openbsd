  # These are variables that apply to all hosts.

  # Below are hosts we want to perform actions on, but not assign them a group
  # which would imply a specific purpose.  One example are hosts that should be
  # patched, but aren't specifically running some type of service as denoted by
  # the name of subsequent groups.
  hosts:
    # This first host definition can be a domain name or IP address
    maudlin.dev:
      pkg_force: "snapshot"

    # Another host definition
    laptop:
      # This isn't required, provided that above you used whatever hostname or
      # IP address that your host can actually reach over ssh.

      pkg_force: "snapshot"

# The "ports" group is a custom group that defines hosts that should be
# configured for building packages in the ports tree.

  # The "children" moniker here allows us to define groups under it, so rather
  # than declaring each host multiple times we can collate the hosts of these
  # groups.
