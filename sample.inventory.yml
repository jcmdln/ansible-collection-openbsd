  # Below are hosts we want to perform actions on, but not assign them a group
  # which would imply a specific purpose.  One example are hosts that should be
  # patched, but aren't specifically running some type of service as denoted by
  # the name of the groups below.
  hosts:
    # This can be a domain name or IP address, and in the example below I've
    # used the hostname and defined the fqdn it points to.
    laptop:
      # This isn't required, provided  that above you used whatever hostname or
      # IP address that your host can actually reach over ssh.
